## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the **Luis Cruz Lab** at Drexel University! 🌟 Our lab is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of **neural networks** and their dynamics. Led by Dr. Luis Cruz, our team uses computational models to understand how the structure of neural networks influences their functioning and behavior. 🧠✨

*Our research focuses on:*

- Spiking Neural Networks: Investigating how neurons communicate and synchronize.
- Brain Plasticity: Understanding how the brain adapts and changes.
- Neuronal Damage Models: Simulating conditions like Alzheimer's to find potential solutions.
  
Join us on our journey to unlock the mysteries of the brain! 🧩🔍

Neural Network! 🧠💡

Feel free to explore our projects and contribute to our mission of advancing neuroscience! 🚀🔬
