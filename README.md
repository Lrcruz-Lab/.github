Welcome to the Luis Cruz Lab at Drexel University! 🌟 Our lab is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of neural networks and their dynamics. Led by Dr. Luis Cruz, our team uses computational models to understand how the structure of neural networks influences their functioning and behavior. 🧠✨

Our research focuses on:

Spiking Neural Networks: Investigating how neurons communicate and synchronize.
Brain Plasticity: Understanding how the brain adapts and changes.
Travelling Waves: Investigating the intrinsic function of traveling waves of neuronal spiking activity.
Join us on our journey to unlock the mysteries of the brain! 🧩🔍
